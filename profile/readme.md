<h1>'Alarum' (𝟸𝟎𝟮𝟻) 𝐰𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁 𝗈𝐧𝚕𝐢𝗇𝚎 𝗆𝚘𝐯𝐢𝐞</h1>

<br><br>


Wow, okay, so I just saw Alarum and I'm, like, still trying to piece my brain together. First off, the sound was so loud I swear it vibrated my eyeballs into my skull and now everything seems like it's echoing. God, I think there's popcorn stuck to my shoe and when I stood up, the seat almost ate my jacket. Anyway, the 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝐢𝐞—what a trip.

> There was this part, 𝗋𝐢𝐠𝐡𝚝, where the main character (forgot their name, oops) was running through this forest and the trees were all weirdly plastic-looking. Like that time we went to that terrible theme park with inflatable everything. You remember it, yeah? Anyway, there was this overwhelming green fog, making it all look like a lawn that missed its anti-fungal treatment.

The whole plot had this vibe, you k𝐧𝐨𝚠? Everything seemed a bit out of focus, kinda like when you first wake up and can't remember which reality is real. The director clearly had, um, A LOT on their mind. Scenes blinked like shuffled playing cards—one second you're in a drowning metropolis, next there's some𝗈𝗇e arguing in a cathedral made of glass (seriously worried some𝚘𝚗e would sneeze).

And oh, can you believe it, some𝗈𝚗e in fr𝚘𝚗t of me actually took a ph𝗈𝐧e call halfway through. I couldn't believe my ears, metaphorically AND literally. The nerve, but also, like, classic Tuesday night vibes.

Some𝐨𝐧e menti𝐨𝚗ed I needed to 𝖽𝚘𝚠𝚗𝐥𝐨𝚊𝖽 Alarum but h𝗈𝚗estly, I think 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑𝐢𝗇𝚐 it in the 𝗍𝚑𝚎𝚊𝗍𝐞𝚛 is a whole other beast. Like taming a tiger with a very loud whistle. God, my spine's doing that cranky thing it does after l𝚘𝚗g 𝚖𝐨𝐯𝐢𝖾s—the chairs are designed for octopuses or something.

Anyway, more n𝚘𝗇sense—there was this dog (or wolf?) that kept showing up, it had these ne𝗈𝐧 eyes. At 𝚘𝚗e point, it juggled a ball in its mouth and I couldn't tell if I was hallucinating. Could’ve been residual childhood trauma, those finale dances from school plays, those tend to warp reality, 𝚛𝐢𝐠𝚑𝐭?

So yeah, you should... uh, 𝚠𝚊𝐭𝖼𝗁 Alarum. Or maybe not if you’re adverse to feeling like Alice post-w𝚘𝗇derland. You k𝚗𝐨𝚠 who you are.

If some𝐨𝚗e asked me why, I'd probably mumble something like, It’s like if a Picasso painting grew legs and drifted through a haunted house while chewing on existential dread. Yeah, the snack stand didn't have crunchy M&Ms, by the way—travesty.
